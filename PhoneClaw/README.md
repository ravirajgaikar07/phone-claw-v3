## 🚀 Quick Start

Getting started with ClawVia is just one command away. Open your Termux app and run the automated installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RavirajGaikar/clawvia/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
1. Set up the necessary Termux packages.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Configure your Python virtual environment.
4. Prepare the `.env` file for you to configure.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The installation script includes an interactive setup wizard that will automatically prompt you for the necessary keys. Have these ready:

1. **Telegram Bot Token** — Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.
2. **Telegram User ID** — Get your numeric ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) (this ensures only you can talk to the agent).
3. **NVIDIA API Key** — Sign up for a free key at [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com).

*If you ever need to manually update your keys or enable additional features (like Groq for Voice Messages), just run `clawvia --config` to edit the `.env` file.*

## 🕹️ Operator Quick Refs

ClawVia comes with a global CLI tool that acts as your control plane. From anywhere in Termux, you can use the `clawvia` command.

### CLI Commands

- `clawvia` — Start the ClawVia server (runs with auto-restart on crash).
- `clawvia --status` — Check if the agent is currently running, along with its PID and Uptime.
- `clawvia --stop` — Safely stop the running instance.
- `clawvia --logs` — Tail the live log output to see what the agent is thinking and doing.
- `clawvia --config` — Open the `.env` configuration file in your editor.
- `clawvia --update` — Pull the latest code from GitHub and automatically flag dependencies for a reinstall.

## 🏗️ Architecture

ClawVia's architecture is modular and designed for extensibility:

- **`agent.py` & `main.py`** — The brain of the operation, managing LLM interactions and state.
- **`telegram_bot.py`** — The primary user interface layer, routing messages to and from the agent.
- **`integrations/` & `mcp_servers/`** — Pluggable modules for external API connectivity (e.g., Notion, Calendar).
- **`skills/` & `tools/`** — Discrete capabilities that the agent can utilize to perform actions on the device or web.
- **`scheduler.py`** — Handles cron-like jobs and delayed actions requested by the user.
